# DisMELS_SnowCrab
This project is a NetBeans module for the DisMELS snow crab IBM. The IBM was initially ported from 
the DisMELS_ArrowtoothFlounder IBM code developed for the GOA IERP. The DisMELS_SnowCrab IBM will be used
to predict the effects of climate change and ocean acidification on snow crab (*Chionoecetes opilio*) in
the eastern Bering Sea.
